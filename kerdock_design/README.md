# kerdock_design
MATLAB codes for the 2018 arXiv paper that uses Kerdock codes to construct unitary 2-designs and logical unitary 2-designs.

To use the scripts and functions in this folder, clone the parent folder (whose link is given below) and add it to your MATLAB path.

You will also need the MATLAB Communication Systems Toolbox since these resources use Galois field arithmetic (e.g., gfmul, gfdiv).

**Scripts**:

*logical_kerdock_design.m*: Execute this script to translate a Kerdock design into a logical unitary 2-design for any stabilizer code, and obtain circuits.                     


**Functions**:

*DGSet.m*: Function to construct the Delsarte-Goethals set DG(m,r).

*KerdockDesign.m*: Function to produce a unitary 2-design using Kerdock sets of matrices.


**Data**:

*TG4_no_frob.mat*: File containing the Kerdock unitary 2-design for m = 4 qubits.

*TG4_642_no_frob.mat*: File containing the physical realizations for the logical unitary 2-design on the 4 protected qubits of the [[6,4,2]] CSS code.

*TG_with_frob.mat*: File containing the enlarged Kerdock unitary 2-design for m = 4 qubits, using the Frobenius automorphisms in GF(2^m).

*TG4_642_with_frob.mat*: File containing the physical realizations for the enlarged logical unitary 2-design on the 4 protected qubits of the [[6,4,2]] CSS code.
